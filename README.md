This is a project that allows for an individual to easily keep track of his or her personal finances in
a more detailed manner than is allowed by programs such as Quicken.  This is not designed for an individual
who relies on bank statements to track their finances, but rather for an individual who wishes to keep a
separate record that they may compare to bank statements.  (One may use this project as an electronic way to
balance a checkbook.)
